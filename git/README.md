# git

Git keeps track of source code files.  You will hear that a lot!  Source code is nothing but text files.  So git keeps track of plane text files.  They DO NOT NEED to be source code. It can be any text file.  For example this file is in [MarkDown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) which is a simple text format that generates nice looking pages when loaded into GitHub.  Its just a text file.

You will find that in software engineers will want to do everything in just text files.  Check out my repo on [diagraming](https://github.com/cbitter78/diagraming) where you can even describe pictures as plane old text files so that git can track them.

Again.. I can not say this enough. git is just a way to save and track text files. Some people call them source files, html, css, java script, perl files, python, golang files.  Its all text.  Nothing but text.

## Learning

To start I would suggest this quick video just to get an idea about git.

After that, I like this video and I love the course notes.   Colt Steele does offer a [udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/git-and-github-bootcamp/) course.  I suggest taking it.
