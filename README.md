# Learn Git

I have found that learning git is one of the most useful things I have ever done in my career.  Operating day to day in git is extremely helpful.  However this has two side effects.  First, I find others engineers may not have the same understand of git to be comfortable operating in it and Second others like Managers, Project Managers and others interested in my work also find git and git hub Intimidating.

Intimidatingâ€½ Well, yes of course it is!  When I first started out [version control systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control) were intimidating.  Though now I think they CVS, SVN, Team Foundation Server are harder to use they were a bit more approachable then git is today. I think that is because it is so powerful and therefore has so many options, switches and workflows.

What you need to understand is. You do not have to learn all of git to be very successful. I have been working with it sense it was released and I only use a small subset of commands in my daily work.  Most people use less than ten commands.  If someone told me I could learn ten commands and be fine, I would have ditch SVN much sooner.

This repository exists to help people who aks me for help with git.  It is part [reference](./git/README.md#reference) and part practical work.  There are two parts. [git](./git/) and [github](./github/).  They go together, and you will find that some people intermingle them.  However for my sanity in git we will cover install, concept, commands, tips, tricks. or anything that happens on your computer.  In the github section we will cover how you work with others.
